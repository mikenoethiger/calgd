 * in the queue.
 *
 * Max-Heap conditions:
 * 1. Its structure is an almost complete binary tree
 * 2. For all heap_elements h:
 *      h->key >= h->left->key  AND
 *      h->key >= h->right->key

 * Data structure for a tree heap.

 * size: Represents the amount of heap elements present in the tree.
 * max_element: A pointer to the max element (based on its key) is maintained.
 * The max element represents the root of the tree.
 * last_element: A pointer to the last inserted element is maintained.
 * Once a heap element is inserted into the tree, its place will never 
 * be changed unless it is removed again.
 * The only possible change in the tree structure is to swap keys of
